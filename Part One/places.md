# The Settlement
Here you can buy rations, practice combat and take your spellbook (or not). Haven't tried leaving the book behind.

# Kristatanti
You'll find an alehouse, an inn and a beggar here. If you give said beggar a coin, he'll offer you a key he claims will help should you be captured by Red-Eyes. (Probably useful in Part Two.) There's also a youngster who says "Snattacats!" for reasons known only to himself.

# Dhumpus
    West of Kris. lies Dhumpus. Along the way you'll encounter a Ratbear, which you can avoid by casting LAW for 3 stamina.
## Explore the Village
Here you'll find a marketplace with a sword for sale(!) Might want to save a few coins. Also, you can get work digging a latrine (3 coins), but this forces you to leave town afterwards.

# Urrustanti
Uphill from Dhumpus is Urrustanti, a plagued village. You can shield yourself from the plague by casting FOF.
