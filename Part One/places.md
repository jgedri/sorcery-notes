# The Settlement
Here you can buy rations, practice combat and take your spellbook (or not). Haven't tried leaving the book behind.

# Kristatanti
You'll find an alehouse, an inn and a beggar here. If you give said beggar a coin, he'll offer you a key he claims will help should you be captured by Red-Eyes. (Probably useful in Part Two.) There's also a youngster who says "Snattacats!" for reasons known only to himself.
