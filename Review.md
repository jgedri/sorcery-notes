# Preface
I've been a fantasy nerd for as long as I can recall, enjoying books, video games and interactive ficion. And so Steve Jackson's *Sorcery!* is right up my alley. Appropriately, it's a kind of chimera: a video game adapted from a book series that plays like a cross between IF and a board game. Truly, the connections are staggering.

Your quest is to recover the Crown of Kings, an artifact that holds sway over men's minds. But is the Crown worth it? That's up to you.
