*It's taken a while, but you've reached Khare, city of traps!*

This part takes place in a single city: Khare. Your mission: to find the lines of a spell that unlocks the North Gate.

# South Gate
Right away, you meet a beggar on the road. Be nice to him; he'll help you get inside. (Besides, who goes around beating up old guys?)

## In Prison
If you're not smart, you go to prison. But fear not! The old fellow here challenges you to a dice game (appropriately named Swindlestones). Win or lose, you'll gain valuable clues.

# The Fields

# The Docks
